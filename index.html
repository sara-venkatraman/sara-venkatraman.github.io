  <p>
    Welcome! I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at <a href="https://stat.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>, where I am advised by Professors <a href="https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells">Martin Wells</a> and <a href="http://faculty.bscb.cornell.edu/~basu/">Sumanta Basu</a>. My research interests are broadly in the analysis of time-evolving phenomena. I especially enjoy thinking about statistical theory and methods for recovering dynamical systems from data. I am also interested in a variety of problems in numerical analysis and high-dimensional statistics, as well as applications of statistics to demography and the social sciences. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously, I studied statistics at <a href="https://statistics.yale.edu">Yale University</a> as a master's student and at Cornell as an undergraduate.

    <b>Other</b><br>

    I am from Los Angeles, California and have also lived in France and the United Kingdom. Outside of statistics, I like drawing/painting and listening to classical piano (especially at the same time). I also enjoy <a href="/photos.html">photography</a>.
