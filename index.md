Welcome! I am a Senior Research Associate in Statistics at [Weill Cornell Medical College](https://globalhealth.weill.cornell.edu/who-we-are) in New York City. I completed my PhD in Statistics in 2024 at [Cornell University](https://stat.cornell.edu), where I was advised by Professors [Martin Wells](https://bowers.cornell.edu/people/martin-t-wells) and [Sumanta Basu](https://sumbose.stat.cornell.edu). My research centers on statistical analysis of temporal and spatial processes, with a particular focus on nonlinear dynamics and estimating systems of differential equations from time series and spatiotemporal data. I am also interested in network science and numerical analysis, and broadly enjoy using statistics to understand complex social, demographic, and health-related phenomena.

Previously, I studied statistics at [Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu) as a master's student and at Cornell as an undergraduate.

## More about me

I am from Los Angeles, California and have also lived in France, where I attended middle and high school. Outside of statistics, I enjoy classical music and [running](https://github.com/sara-venkatraman/Running). My favorite dataset is the [New York Philharmonic Performance History Database](https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory).

As a PhD student, I co-organized the Cornell math/statistics [Directed Reading Program](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/cornell-drp), which pairs undergraduates with PhD students to work on semester-long reading projects on topics of mutual interest.
