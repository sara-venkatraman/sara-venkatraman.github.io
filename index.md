Welcome! I am a final-year PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at [Cornell University](https://stat.cornell.edu). My advisors are Professors [Martin Wells](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells) and [Sumanta Basu](http://faculty.bscb.cornell.edu/~basu/). I also collaborate with the Division of General Internal Medicine at [Weill Cornell Medical College](https://medicine.weill.cornell.edu/divisions-programs/general-internal-medicine) in New York City, which is where I am currently based. 

My research is broadly in the analysis of temporal and spatial phenomena. I am particularly interested in nonlinear dynamical systems, and I enjoy thinking about theory and methods for learning systems of differential equations and their properties from time series data. I also work on statistical methods for identifying spatial patterns of evolution over time in demographic and epidemiological contexts. Other areas of statistics and math that I like studying include network science and numerical analysis.

Previously, I studied statistics at [Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu) as a master's student and at Cornell as an undergraduate.

## More about me

I am from Los Angeles, California and have also lived in France, where I attended middle and high school. Outside of statistics, I enjoy classical music and [running](https://github.com/sara-venkatraman/Running). My favorite dataset is the [New York Philharmonic Performance History Database](https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory).

I co-organize the Cornell math/statistics [Directed Reading Program](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/cornell-drp), which pairs undergraduates with PhD students to work on semester-long reading projects on topics of mutual interest.
