Welcome! I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at [Cornell University](https://stat.cornell.edu). My advisors are Professors [Martin Wells](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells) and [Sumanta Basu](http://faculty.bscb.cornell.edu/~basu/). I also collaborate with the Division of General Internal Medicine at [Weill Cornell Medical College](https://medicine.weill.cornell.edu/divisions-programs/general-internal-medicine) in New York City, which is where I am currently based. 

My research is broadly in the analysis of temporal and spatial phenomena. I enjoy thinking about theory and methods for fitting models often used in applied mathematics, such as ordinary and partial differential equations, to time series data. I also work on statistical methods for identifying spatial patterns of evolution over time in demographic and epidemiological contexts. Other areas of statistics and math that I like studying include network science, numerical analysis, and optimal transport.

Previously, I studied statistics at [Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu) as a master's student and at Cornell as an undergraduate.

## More about me

I am from Los Angeles, California and have also lived in France, where I attended middle and high school, and the United Kingdom. Outside of statistics, I enjoy classical piano, painting, [photography](/photos.html), [running](https://github.com/sara-venkatraman/Running), and exploring New York City. My favorite dataset is the [New York Philharmonic Performance History Database](https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory).

I co-organize the math/statistics [Directed Reading Program](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/cornell-drp) at Cornell, which pairs undergraduates with PhD students to work on semester-long reading projects on topics of mutual interest.

This means that many examples are taken from probability; that probabilistic concepts such as independence, Markov processes, and conditional expectations are integrated into me rather than being relegated to an appendix; that more attention is paid to the role of algebras than is customary; and that the metric defining the distance between sets as the measure of their symmetric difference is exploited more than is customary. </p><p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be? <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>
