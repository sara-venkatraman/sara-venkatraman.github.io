Welcome! I am a rising third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at [Cornell University](https://stat.cornell.edu), where I am advised by Professors [Martin Wells](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells) and [Sumanta Basu](http://faculty.bscb.cornell.edu/~basu/). 

My research interests are broadly in the analysis of time-evolving phenomena. I especially enjoy thinking about statistical theory and methods for recovering dynamical systems from data. I am also interested in a variety of problems in numerical analysis, network science, and optimal transport, as well as applications of statistics to demography and the social sciences. 

Previously, I studied statistics at [Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu) as a master's student and at Cornell as an undergraduate.

## More about me

I am from Los Angeles, California and have also lived in France, where I attended middle and high school, and the United Kingdom. Outside of statistics, I enjoy Romantic-era classical piano, drawing, painting, and [photography](/photos.html). My favorite dataset is the [New York Philharmonic Performance History Database](https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory).

I co-organize the math/statistics [Directed Reading Program](https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/cornell-drp) at Cornell, which pairs undergraduates with PhD students to work on semester-long reading projects on topics of mutual interest.
